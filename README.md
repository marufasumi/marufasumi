### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Marufa Sumi
#### I am Software Developer

Iâ€™m a technology professional with a versatile skill set spanning Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) authoring, Salesforce development and administration, and full-stack software engineering. Iâ€™m certified in Salesforce and have hands-on experience with tools like Java, Spring, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to contribute across the entire software development lifecycle.

In my recent role, I wore two hats: as an AEM Author, I streamlined content management processes and optimized digital asset workflows, and as a Salesforce Developer, I enhanced system efficiency, automated workflows, and ensured data accuracy and security. I also supported comprehensive QA testing, bringing a meticulous approach to ensuring smooth functionality.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve built full-stack web applications as part of my development training, and my background in the pharmaceutical industry has sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills. With certifications in Salesforce Data Cloud and AI, Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions and drive impactful results.

If youâ€™re looking for someone who can bring versatility, dedication, and a collaborative spirit to your team, letâ€™s connectâ€”Iâ€™d love to explore how I can contribute to your success!

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS/Java/ Salesforce (Apex, SOQL, Flows)/ S SQL,/PostgreSQL/AEM Authoring
