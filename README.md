### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Marufa Sumi
#### I am a Salesforce  Developer & Full stack Software Engineer

Iâ€™m a certified Salesforce Developer and Administrator with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a passion for building scalable, user-centric solutions. With hands-on experience across Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Flows, Apex, and Lightning Web Components (LWC), I specialize in customizing Salesforce platforms to meet diverse business needs.

My journey started in the pharmaceutical industry, and I later transitioned into technology where Iâ€™ve contributed to organizations in automotive, IT, and digital content management (AEM). I've developed automation processes, written Apex code within governor limits, built reports and dashboards, and created user-friendly experiences that drive productivity and insight.

Outside of Salesforce, I bring strong Java and Spring Boot development skills and have contributed to content authoring roles using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and using tech to solve real-world problems.
